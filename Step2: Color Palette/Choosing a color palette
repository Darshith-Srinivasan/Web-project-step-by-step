When designing a website, you don’t just “pick random colors.”
You choose specific types of colors, each with a role in the UI.
This makes your design clean, consistent, and professional.

Here are the essential color types every website should have:

✅ 1. Primary Color (Brand Color)

This is your main identity color.

Used for:

Logo

Main buttons (CTA)

Links

Highlighted elements

Important icons

Characteristics:

Strong, recognizable, and used consistently

Should reflect the brand’s mood (trust, youth, luxury, eco, etc.)

Examples:
Blue (#1E90FF), Green (#2D8A6E), Purple (#6C4BF4)

✅ 2. Secondary Color

A supporting color that complements the primary.

Used for:

Secondary buttons

Banners/sections

Illustrations or highlights

Tabs/navigation states

Characteristics:

Should not overpower the primary

Used less frequently

Often derived from the same color family (analogous)

Examples:
If primary is blue → teal, navy, or light blue.

✅ 3. Accent Color

A bold color used sparingly for attention-grabbing purposes.

Used for:

Call-to-Action buttons (Buy Now, Sign Up)

Important highlights

Notifications

Price tags or important numbers

Characteristics:

High contrast

Eye-catching

Used in very small amounts (1–5%)

Examples:
Orange (#FF8A00), Coral (#FF6B6B), Lime (#A1E44D)

✅ 4. Neutral Colors (Base Colors)

These form the background, text, and layout structure.

Includes:

Whites (#FFFFFF)

Light greys (#F5F5F5, #EEEEEE)

Dark greys (#111111, #333333)

Used for:

Page background

Text

Borders

Cards

Shadows

Characteristics:

Foundation of the design

Should dominate 60–80% of your layout

Makes primary & accent colors stand out

✅ 5. Semantic Colors (Feedback Colors)

Used for status, messages, feedback.

Types:

Success → Green

Warning → Orange/Yellow

Error/Danger → Red

Info → Blue

Used for:

Form validations

Alerts

Badges

Graphs/analytics

System messages

Examples:
Success (#16A34A), Warning (#F59E0B), Danger (#DC2626)

✅ 6. Background Colors

Specific neutrals for different UI layers:

Types:

Main background (usually very light or very dark)

Surface background (cards, sections)

Header/footer background

Examples:
Main background: #FFFFFF
Surface: #F7F7F7
Dark mode background: #0D0D0D

✅ 7. Text Colors

Three levels of text clarity:

Primary text → #111111

Secondary/muted text → #6B7280

Disabled text → #9CA3AF

Characteristics:

High contrast for readability

Should always pass WCAG contrast rules

✔️ Summary Table (Easy Cheat Sheet)

Accent	Highlights, CTAs, grabs attention
Neutral	Backgrounds, text, borders
Semantic	Success, warning, error, info

Points to consider for layout of your page:

1. Define the Purpose of the Website
Before drawing anything, ask:
What is the website for? (Portfolio, Blog, E-commerce, Company, Dashboard…)
Who is the target audience?
What action should users take? (Signup, Read, Buy, Contact, Explore)

👉 Purpose decides layout.

A blog layout ≠ an e-commerce layout ≠ a dashboard layout.

2. List All the Content & Features
Write down everything your site needs:
Header (logo, nav)
Sidebar?
Hero section / banner?
About section?
Services?
Product cards?
Footer?
Forms, filters, images, buttons, menus?

👉 You cannot pick a layout unless you know what must fit inside it.

3. Choose the Navigation Style
Decide how users will move around:
Top navigation bar?
Sidebar navigation?
Hamburger menu (mobile)?
Mega menu (large sites)?

👉 Navigation affects the entire layout structure.

4. Sketch Wireframes (Very Important)
Make a simple rough layout (even on paper):
Example:
-------------------
|    Header       |
-------------------
| Sidebar | Body  |
-------------------
|   Footer        |
-------------------
Or:
Header
Banner
3 Boxes
Content
Footer


👉 Sketch 3–5 versions and pick the best one.

5. Decide Layout Technique
Choose how you will build the layout:
CSS Flexbox (good for rows/columns)
CSS Grid (best for full page layout)
Bootstrap / Tailwind (faster UI building)
Plain CSS + media queries (fully custom)

👉 Today, CSS Grid is the best for large layout structure.

6. Plan Responsiveness (Mobile → Tablet → Desktop)
Ask yourself:
How should this look on mobile?
Should the sidebar collapse?
Should the menu become a burger menu?
Should columns stack on top of each other?

Design layouts for:
Mobile first
Tablet
Desktop

👉 Use media queries or responsive frameworks.
